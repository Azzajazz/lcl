# TODO List

## Bug fixes
- Improvements on error messages (on hold until the language is useable)

## Feature adds
- Control flow structures (branches + loops)
- Check for use-before-declared, etc (sanitizer)
- Type checking

## Optimizations
- Ring buffer in lexer so that peeked tokens aren't processed twice.
