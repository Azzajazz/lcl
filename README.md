# lcl

This project is a compiler for a toy language. The language is currently in early development and as such has no stable semantics. Watch this space.

## Goals
This language aims to mitigate a lot of the things that C is missing for ease of use. These include:
- Polymorphic functions
- Polymorphic data structures
- Operator overloading
- Sane conversions between numeric types

Some extra features that may or may not be added are
- Function overloading
- Typeclasses/traits

As development continues, these lists may change.
